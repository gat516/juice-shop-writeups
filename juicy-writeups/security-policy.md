# Security Policy Writeup

## Challenge Description
Behave like any "white-hat" should before getting into the action.

## Solution
1. I looked for a security policy or responsible disclosure policy on the website.
2. I checked common locations like `/security.txt`, `/.well-known/security.txt`, or security pages.
3. I found the security policy that explains how to report vulnerabilities responsibly.
4. Reading this policy completed the challenge.

## Steps
- Look for security policy links on the website
- Check `/.well-known/security.txt` or `/security.txt`
- Read the responsible disclosure policy

## Reflection
This challenge taught me about responsible disclosure. White-hat hackers should always read security policies before testing for vulnerabilities. It's important to follow proper procedures when reporting security issues to avoid legal problems.
