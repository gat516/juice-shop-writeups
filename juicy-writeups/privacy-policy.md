# Privacy Policy Inspection Writeup

## Challenge Description
Read our privacy policy.

## Solution
1. I looked for a privacy policy link on the website.
2. I found it in the footer or sometimes in the legal section.
3. I clicked on the privacy policy link.
4. The challenge was completed just by reading (or opening) the policy.

## Steps
- Scroll to the bottom of any page
- Look for "Privacy Policy" link in the footer
- Click on it to read the policy

## Reflection
This was the easiest challenge ever! Just had to click a link. But it's actually important to read privacy policies to understand how websites use your data. Most people (including me) usually just skip them.
