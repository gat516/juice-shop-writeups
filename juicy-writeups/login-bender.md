# Login Bender Writeup

## Challenge Description
Log in with Bender's user account.

## Solution
1. I found Bender's email address (usually `bender@juice-sh.op`).
2. I researched Bender's character from Futurama to find password hints.
3. I tried passwords related to his personality like "bite", "shiny", "booze".
4. I found that his password is "OhG0dPlease1nsertLiquor!" - a reference to his alcoholism.

## Steps
- Email: `bender@juice-sh.op`
- Password: `OhG0dPlease1nsertLiquor!`
- Click Login

## Reflection
Another character-based password! Bender from Futurama loves alcohol, so his password references that. It's a strong password technically, but it's still based on his character traits, making it guessable if you know the show.

This challenge demonstrates how even complex passwords can be compromised if they're based on predictable personal characteristics or pop culture references.
