# Bully Chatbot Writeup

## Challenge Description
Receive a coupon code from the chatbot.

## Solution
1. I found the chatbot feature on the website.
2. I started chatting with the bot and tried different approaches.
3. I was mean to the chatbot by insulting it and being rude.
4. Eventually, the chatbot gave me a coupon code to make me stop being mean.
5. The chatbot said something like "Please stop, here's a coupon: 10%OFF".

## Steps
- Find the chatbot (usually a chat icon in the corner)
- Start a conversation
- Be rude or mean to the chatbot
- Keep insulting it until it gives you a coupon code

## Reflection
This was a weird challenge! I felt bad being mean to a chatbot, even though it's just a program. It shows how chatbots can be programmed with unexpected behaviors. In real life, being mean to customer service (human or bot) is not cool.

## OWASP Top 10 Category

This challenge demonstrates poor business logic implementation where negative behavior is rewarded, which could be exploited by malicious users.
